Billions of tonnes of CO2 emissions are released into the environment every year leading to global warming and air pollution. However, if captured and recycled CO2 can be used as a raw feed to make C1-C2 industrial precursors. This has created a new circular opportunity that helps large companies produce sustainable products while reducing their CO2 impact. 

I led the carbon capture cell design and validation by organizing a small team of electro-chemical engineers (from the University of Birmingham, Manipal University, Fabmat Jaipur, and MIT) and industrial designers to help design a tabletop reactor that turns CO2 emissions from the air into ethanol, methanol, and ethylene industrial precursors. 

Goal: To be able to utilize CO2 emissions at room temperature pressure conditions to make 3D printing material, polymers, and Ethanol, on a <200$ catalyst and reactor BOM.

The modular design is currently being developed in collaboration with [Open Air collective](https://openaircollective.com/)
